# Product-Recommendation-System

Developed a system using the K-means algorithm to group customers based on their typical purchasing behavior.
For customers who have extreme or very low purchasing power, We applied the KNN algorithm to assign them to
the most suitable cluster. Then, we used collaborative filtering to recommend the best products to each customer
group based on their purchasing power and past behavior.
